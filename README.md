###Cardiovascular Risk Calculator

see https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/about-fhs/history.php

The Framingham Heart Study started in 1948, its objective was to to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardio vascular disease.From the study, key contributors to cardio vascular risk were found. 
The relationship between risk and these variables has been fine tuned in recent years and a risk assessment cab be calculated.

This calculator is based on the spreadsheet which can be downloaded from https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/risk-functions/spreadsheets/gencardio_lipids.xls

##How to use:

**Inputs**

Age: Use slider to enter your age

Units: Choose units for Cholesterol Measurements mmol/l or mg/dl. **Note: To reveal the changed unit inputs, you need to refresh by pushing the submit button below.**

Total cholesterol: Enter your total mmol/L Cholesterol level

HDL cholesterol:   Enter your total mmol/L HDL (Good) Cholesterol level

Systolic Blood Pressure: This is the upper limit eg for 130 over 90 enter 130

Treatment for High Blood Pressure: Are you being treated for hypertension? Yes/No

Diabetes: Do you have Diabetes?	Yes/No

Smoking:  Do you Smoke?	Yes/No

**Outputs**

Your Cardio Vascular Age: A measure of how well you're doing compared to your real age

Your Risk: Your risk of having a cardio vascular event in the next 10 years.

Optimal Risk: The risk of an overly healthy with no vices whatsoever your age having a cardio vascular event in the next 10 years.

Normal Risk:  The risk of an average person of your age having a cardio vascular event in the next 10 years.

Individuals with low risk have 10% or less CHD risk at 10 years, with intermediate risk 10-20%, and with high risk 20% or more. However it should be remembered that these categorisations are arbitrary.
